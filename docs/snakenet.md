The time is here. We'll need fellow Hydraheads to join our incentivized testnet (Stakenet) and help us extend current limitations and point us where to improve. 

The testnet will be split into different phases and, at some point, it will transition into a fully working mainnet. The balances of HDX token rewards during this phase will be transitioned to the mainnet.

For now, we will hold sudo keys in case of a bug or an issue on our side that may lead to a loss of funds. We would like to reserve a right to revert any such mishap.
